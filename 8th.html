                    <p>
                    Ever since I have read the book, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Reading_and_Writing_the_World_with_Mathe/WVD7fMo1PAcC?hl=en&gbpv=0">“Reading and Writing the World with Mathematics,”</a> along with taking several classes about race, history, and Latina/o Studies at a graduate school, one of my goals has been to support critical consciousness of my students. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    One day, I watched a video about race and racism and was struck by this statement: There is a disparity of trees between different neighborhoods. This led me to conduct research and create a project for students to develop their critical consciousness and participate in civic engagement. I hope this contributes you and your students to take a step toward creating equity and social justice in your classroom.
