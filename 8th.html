                    <p>
          	    When I found out that the school where I previously worked at was going to launch a Project Based Learning curriculum, I was one of the few who volunteered to take the course. I was really excited to bring this to my students! </p>
		    
                    <p>
                    After learning about steps that I needed to take, I carefully designed the project. First, I needed to know what would motivate my students - and it was Lunch! I then incorporated it in the design and I never saw them so engaged in their projects! My students even presented their ideas to the principal and I was so proud of them.</p>
		    
		    <p> This is my sincere hope that this would also support your students to be excited and engaged in this project.</p>
